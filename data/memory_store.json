Write down the three tasks on separate sheets or lines within your digital to-do list, making sure each task has enough space next to it for notes and progress tracking.\n\n2. Allocate specific time slots for each task, making sure to account for any breaks in between tasks as well. Remember to factor in the duration of each task and allow some extra time for unexpected interruptions or unforeseen challenges that might arise.\n\n3. As you work through your tasks, check them off as completed and take a moment to reflect on what went well and where improvements can be made. This process helps reinforce positive habits and promotes personal growth.\n\n4. At the end of the day, review your accomplishments and assess whether any adjustments are needed for future planning."
